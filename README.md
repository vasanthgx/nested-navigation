Project Name: Interactive Nested Menu Component

Description:
This project implements a reusable React component for creating an interactive, nested menu structure. The component allows for the creation of multi-level menus where each menu item can have its own set of child items. Users can dynamically expand or collapse these nested items, providing an intuitive navigation experience.

Key Features:
1. Hierarchical Menu Structure: Supports multiple levels of nested menu items.

2. Interactive Toggle: Each parent menu item includes a toggle button ('+' or '-') to show or hide its children.

3. Dynamic State Management: Utilizes React's useState hook to manage the visibility state of child items efficiently.

4. Recursive Rendering: Employs a MenuList component to render child items, allowing for infinite levels of nesting.

5. Conditional Rendering: Optimizes performance by only rendering child items and toggle buttons when necessary.

6. Customizable Icons: Uses react-icons for expandable indicators, allowing for easy customization of the visual interface.

7. Flexible Data Structure: Accepts a nested data structure for menu items, making it adaptable to various data formats.

Technical Stack:
- React.js
- React Hooks (useState)
- react-icons for UI elements

Potential Use Cases:
1. Navigation menus for complex websites
2. File system explorers
3. Organizational chart displays
4. Product category browsers in e-commerce applications
5. Settings or configuration panels in web applications

This component offers a flexible and efficient solution for displaying hierarchical data structures in a user-friendly, interactive format. Its modular design allows for easy integration into larger React applications, providing developers with a powerful tool for creating dynamic, nested menu systems.
